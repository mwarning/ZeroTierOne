/*
 * The big picture:
 *
 * tryDecode gets called for a given fully-assembled packet until it returns
 * true or the packet's time to live has been exceeded, in which case it is
 * discarded as failed decode. Any exception thrown by tryDecode also causes
 * the packet to be discarded.
 *
 * Thus a return of false from tryDecode() indicates that it should be called
 * again. Logic is very simple as to when, and it's in doAnythingWaitingForPeer
 * in Switch. This might be expanded to be more fine grained in the future.
 *
 * A return value of true indicates that the packet is done. tryDecode must
 * never be called again after that.
